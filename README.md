1.  Implement Affine Cipher.
2.  Implement Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
3. Select a simple message. Perform a hash function on it.
      i) Simulate a receiver computing the hash again and ensuring its integrity.
      ii) Slightly change the message. Simulate a receiver computing hash and find it not 
          matching.
4. a)  Create a password file of 10 passwords and use it for identification.
    b)  Modify one to store the hash values of passwords & use it.
    c)  Optional: Create a salt file; add salt to password before storing in (b). 
 5. Generate a symmetric key by using Diffie-Hellman method given g, p, x and y
